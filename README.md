Data Analytics Portfolio
========================

Turning data into clear, actionable insight.

About Me
--------

I’m a data analyst who enjoys translating messy, real-world data into concise stories that drive decisions. I work end‑to‑end: scoping questions with stakeholders, building reliable data pipelines, and delivering analyses and visuals that are easy to act on. My work emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and thoughtful communication.

Skills
------

- **SQL**: querying, CTEs, window functions, optimization
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, duckdb, matplotlib/seaborn, notebooks
- **R**: tidyverse, ggplot2 (as needed for visualization/reporting)
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: modeling, pivot tables, data cleaning
- **Visualization**: dashboards, clear static charts, data storytelling
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub, PRs, code reviews
- **Reproducibility**: environments, requirements, templated analyses

Projects
--------

- **Housing Portfolio** — time-series analysis of U.S. home values, including growth rates, volatility, and the 2007–2009 downturn, with reproducible scripts and figures.
